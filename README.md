# Protein-Structure-Prediction #-
- We successfully implemented an attention-based model that accurately predicts Protein structure.
- We trained our model in two ways, one by having the Secondary protein structure matrix as input and the other by taking the Protein sequence as input.
- The model performance could be improved by using MSA as training data.
- Also, In this approach we are calculating Angles as the target, which could be replaced by coordinate distance and coordinates for better and accurate protein structure prediction.
